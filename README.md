# NoteX

NoteX is a portable Windows text and code editor based on Notepad++ 8.9.8.1.
It adds visual text formatting, a redesigned
toolbar, customizable menus, and formatting-aware session recovery.
This is an independent modified distribution maintained by Berk Kivircik.

## Download and run

Download `NoteX-1.3.1-portable-x64.zip` from the
[1.3.1 release](https://github.com/berkkivircik/NoteX/releases/tag/v1.3.1),
extract it to a writable folder, and run `NoteX.exe`. No installer is required.
The public package starts with a fresh profile and no documents or session history.
Windows x64 is required. This release is unsigned.

## Features

- Apply fonts, sizes, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, and colors to text ranges.
- Set the format for text you type next, copy formatting, and create lists.
- Use line and caret heights that follow the formatting on each line.
- Reorder and hide menu items with persistent menu customization.
- Recover unsaved text and formatting through session snapshots.
- Use English, Turkish, or Spanish interface translations; syntax highlighting
  support is independent of the interface language.

Formatting is stored separately in `.notex` companion files. Previous portable-release companions and menu settings are migrated without
resetting document formatting or menu preferences.
The package uses GDI rendering and disables upstream automatic updates.
Optional third-party plugins and the upstream updater are not bundled in this
public release. They are not required for the editor's built-in features.

## Source and build

The repository includes the modified editor, Scintilla, Lexilla, Boost.Regex,
build scripts, tests, and portable packaging inputs. See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).
The `v1.3.1` tag and `NoteX-1.3.1-source.zip` release asset identify the source
for the matching portable binary. Do not substitute upstream Notepad++ source
or a different NoteX revision when redistributing this binary.

## Upgrading an existing portable installation

Close the application normally and back up the complete existing directory.
Keep the same installation path. Preserve `config.xml`, `session.xml*`, `backup/`,
`.notex` companions, menu settings, user shortcuts, translations, and customized
syntax/theme files. Replace application files without deleting the profile.
The fresh-install ZIP contains default configuration; do not overwrite a user's
configuration with those defaults. Earlier companion filenames are accepted
and migrated when the corresponding document is loaded. A current companion is
preferred when both versions exist; conflicting files are never overwritten.
